[Data](https://github.com/donga0223/Comparing-Forecast-Comparison/tree/main/Data) contains R code for getting data from COVID19forecast hub and obtaining scores, and calculating loss differences..
[Simulation1](https://github.com/donga0223/Comparing-Forecast-Comparison/tree/main/Simulation1) includes Python code for simulating data generation using our proposed model and fitting the model to the generated data.
[Simulation2](https://github.com/donga0223/Comparing-Forecast-Comparison/tree/main/Simulation2) contains Python code for simulating data from an ARMA model and fitting it using our proposed model, both with and without heteroskedasticity.
[Application](https://github.com/donga0223/Comparing-Forecast-Comparison/tree/main/Application) contains python code to fit the model to real data.
